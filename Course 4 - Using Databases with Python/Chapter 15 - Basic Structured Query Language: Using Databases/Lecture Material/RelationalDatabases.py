'Relational Databases'
#Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables. The power of the relational database lies in its ability
#to efficiently retrieve data from those tables and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships
#between those tables involved in the query.

'Terminology'
#Database - contains many tables
#Relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes
#Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track.
#Attribute (also column or field) - one of possible many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by tje row

'''
#A relation is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes. A tuple usually represents an object and information
#about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized
#into rows and columns. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.

'SQL'
#Structured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the database
#   -Create a table
#   -Retrieve some data
#   -Insert data
#   -Delete data
